A rather quick, and not too eventful week.

Big higlights would be that we're back on The 100 Club sales train. It's funny, now that I'm running it on the side, reaching out feels a bit better and I'm even using it as a way to procrastinate. Note to self: if there's something you actually need to do, run it as a side thing. Only half joking. Managed to clinch a few sales this week which is always a big booster and scheduled quite a few meetings for next week as well.

I've also finished the landing page for Labyrinth and outlined a sort of plan for it. No doubt where the inspiration for the page aesthetic came from. Those who know what I'm talking about, know. I've begun reaching out as well to restaurant owners, but they've got pretty much 0 digital presence so the only way is to go through their restaurant email. Not sure it's the most effective way, but we'll give it a shot. I quite enjoy replicating these websites. Almost a hobby of sorts, and really quite brain dead, especially since the design part if the one that really makes my brain hurt.

I'm a little concerned that my days are becoming paper pushing, with meaningless action that makes me feel better, but isn't really moving the business needle. Which is not great. How to combat it? Not too sure. Stop procrastinating the important things. In Labyrinth's case, outreach maybe. I always do and set up everything needed, except for the thing which is actually needed - outreach / sales. A common problem I think amongst all the Indie Hackers. But I'll get down to it. The 100 Club, if anything, is a case of how we can positively move a needle.

Considering using this as my weekly long form reflection moving forward and Twitter potentially as a daily reflection, for faster iteration. There are a lot of thoughts I want to pen down, but honestly, I don't want people to know who I am. Prefer remaining anonymous, especially on Twitter, so should I use an alias? Hmmm. I think no, for now. But if I feel like it's really impeding what I share, then I might. Think I'll spend 2200-2230 everyday reading my one chapter, and then reflecting for the day by posting on Twitter. Sounds like a decent plan, we'll see whether I stick to it.

Oh and I also reached out to connect with a few mastermind community founders as well. Some incredible people that honestly, I would love to work for. I feel like there's a lot I can learn, and confident I can contribute extensively (in case any of these people are reading this now). But I guess the question is whether I contribute in my technical capacity which is more valuable career and skill wise, or contribute in a community, jack-of-all-trades, second man, type of role. Well, I suppose they aren't mutually exclusive. But I'll have to refine my offer, assuming any are willing to consider.
