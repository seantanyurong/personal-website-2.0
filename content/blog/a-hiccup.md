This week was kind of a blip for me. Not a productive week and nothing eventful really happened. Struggled to maintain the schedule that I set out for myself. Was initially considering not writing anything here, but figured the least I could was stick to this. I'm pretty sure a single lapse would open the door to a string of lapses down the road. I feel like trying to do an internet / screen ban for a day or two and see how I feel. Anyways, time for me to get back on the train next week, hopefully.
