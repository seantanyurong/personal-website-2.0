title: "My First Week of Summer."

So I'm considering my past week my first official week of summer even though I'm technically a month in. First week was an NOC module, second week was down sick, third week was travelling, which brings me to last week.

Finally had time to just sit down and hash out a lot of things in the backlog, which is always great.

Wasn't too eventful of a week, with most days consisting of me whacking out my BAUs at The 100 Club, and the afternoons left to look through various communities, their niches and their monetisation strategies. This week just makes it more evident than ever that I always need to be working on something, with the alternative being me dying of incredible boredom and restlessness.

One highlight of the week is that I think I've finally settled on a community niche I can build towards for the first month in my twelve month challenge. Will see how it goes in June I suppose.

Another highlight was a recent podcast I listened to with Nir Eyal, the author of Hooked and Indistractable, which is just about attention control. I'm generally not a huge fan of self-help books and all the productivity stuff, but I have noticed that I've been falling a bit off the wagon lately - barely being able to sit down for prolonged preiods and engage in deep work less the few precious hours I get in the morning, if I do decide to properly get out of bed. I think the biggest tactic he shared was just the idea that when you feel like getting distracted, delay the distraction by 10-mins. Don't indulge your immediate urges, but instead pause and reflect why you have such an urge. He shared that it's likely due to some sort of discomfort associated with the task at hand. After all, you don't really get distracted when you're doing something you enjoy. So hopefully, this is a little nudge to get back on the wagon for the coming months.

Oh and before I forget, I also attended my first magic convention of sorts with friends, which is always cool. It was a full day of magic, and we got to play a lot and meet a bunch of cool people. It's always cool to see how high the skill ceiling is for magic and while I've always wanted to play some competitive constructed format, I'm beginning to see the beauty of limited, as the NUS group starts getting filled with more drafters. Interesting, considering it's something I thought I never liked.
