Tiring week.

Went out a lot for events and stuff. Started planning the Twitter journey. Good sales for The 100 Club. Trying to think less when launching new initiatives under The 100 Club to generate more sales, which is something I've been picking up from the really successful guys I'm talking to. Current things in the pipeline is an affiliate programme since referrals seem to be a really strong method of growth for us. Thinking about open sourcing Dungeon Meetup as well to anybody else who's interested in building it out. There are a lot of developers x MTG players as well, so seems like a good line. Another founder also reached out with a new opportunity to join his team. It's in a space I'm quite interested in, and we've talked quite a bit, but I'll have to properly weigh all the pros and cons.
