What is my default state?
Grinding at work and money. Hobbying outside. Chilling indoors.

What makes me happy?
Monetary success and the recognition of success. Hobbies.

What doesn't make me happy?
I want to say interacting with people, but I do enjoy doing activities with friends / strangers. I just dislike the idea of networking events. I also hate having to compare myself to other people.

What?
So you want recognition, but you don't really want to interact with people? Pretty much. Paradoxical. And to top it all off, I actually like working behind the scenes as an operator.

Ok, how can I get the best of both worlds?
Build a presence online maybe. Maybe with anonymity to help support the behind the scenes feature. And just focus on doing shit that makes money, like working as an operator.

What am I good at?
I'm a very good operator. Maybe not so much a founder.

What's my brand then?
Introverted guy who makes a lot of money at home. Interested in community businesses as an operator. Background as a full-stack engineer.

So what should I do in SV?
Start making a fuck ton of money by trying to work as an EA. Fuck events if I don't want to attend them. Build out twitter following.
