Quite a bit of time this week spent just coding, reading and attending networking events.

Picked up The Wheel of Time again since I came across it in a library, and figured I would give it a proper shot this time to actually finish the entire series. I've read the first book before, enjoyed it decently, but some parts that tapered off for me led me not to continue on with the rest of the series. But I was in the mood for some high fantasy after experiencing a whiff with Dean Koontz's The Big Dark Sky. Just a pretty meh read overall that I DNFed. I think the reent collaboration between Lord of the Rings and Magic might also contributed a little to me getting back on the fantasy train, and so far, no regrets. Although I think Rober Jordan is known for being heavy on description, which I tend to skim.

Finished up the [Pace Fitness website](https://www.joinpacefitness.com/) after making the migration over to NextJS, actually purely because of their image component. Images just perform awfully poorly no matter how much I try to optimise with lazy loading, webp formatting, compression, using platforms like cloudinary to host the images, etc. But NextJS's image component runs it a lot better.

Started messing around with the T3 stack again this week as well, working on [Dungeon Meetup](https://dungeon-meetup.vercel.app/) and I have to say it feels good to get back to coding again. Typescript is still something that I need time to get used to, but the whole stack is something that's coming a lot easier compared to preivous times I've utilised it. Liking the aesthetic of the Dungeon Meetup website so far. Pretty much using the Hampton template, modified, and some Cruip job board template to house the playgroups, with personal modifications of course.

And then just attended networking events this week, one from the 100C and two from others. Think everything went well on a whole. We're making a slight adjustment in how we run masterminds in The 100 Club in July that is a little risky, but I think sets us up better moving forward. So looking forward to seeing how we can grow even more aggressively in the future and provide even more value to our members.
