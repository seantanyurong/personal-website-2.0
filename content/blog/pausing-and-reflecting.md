A recent workshop I attended discussed the power of gaining clarity through penning down thoughts.

Figured I'd give it a shot, since I've been going back and forth on a few things. And hopefully this will be a chance to straighten them out before it gets too late.

## The 100 Club

I'm not gonna lie. Building something from scratch and following through for a prolonged period of time is tough. We've come a long way with The 100 Club, from it being just an idea literally a year ago. It's now a revenue generating "business" with paying customers, that's incubated at SMU BIG. I'm proud of what the team has managed to achieve, or at least that's what I want to tell myself. Most products never get to make money, and we have, albeit not a huge, huge sum. Our members love what we do, with really positive reviews for our masterminds. The people I've been able to meet and learn about through this have been pretty epic as well. But I ask myself whether this is that "thing". The one idea that will lead me to my retirement dream, and I'm not so sure. My First Million's Sam Parr recently launched Hampton, which is pretty much what we're doing, but for big guys. It's honestly a big vote of confidence for what is possible in the space. And I'm often left asking myself what I would change if I could get a do over. I initially thought there was a lot, but in hindsight, maybe not so much. So I'm left with the decision now on whether to continue on growing this, or putting it on the side and establishing BAU as much as I can. The latter is currently already in progress as the team tries to lock down our SOPs, although we've been saying that for the past few months. It's surprising how much it takes to run a business, as operational as this one. I believe the problem is that the Singapore market really is too small, for founders. It feels like everybody in our target market already knows about us; and it's not easy finding the pockets of founders who aren't on any platforms. Or is this just an excuse given that the alternative is that we've been steering the ship wrong. I'm not too sure. Now I'm saying all this like The 100 Club is some huge failure or something, when in actuality, it really isn't. I think this is a common line of thought amongst even established founders whose businesses are skyrocketing, and them just wanting out. This piece is just an opportunity for me to determine why I want out. And by out, I mean still continue to run it on the side, but with less stress and drive and growing it to be the golden goose. I think it's clear that I should put it to the side. There's not much I can do to really help expand it even further, with the market being as limited as it is. The ROI on time isn't very worth it either. The only thing really holding me back is the notion that I should stick to one thing instead of jumping about, but is that really a concern, given I've been running this for close to a year? On a separate note, I find running something on the side to be a weird notion. It's hard to segregate the time. When you're putting in effort, then it feels like maybe you shouldn't be? I'm not too sure.

## So what's next then?

Upwork? Donna? Grinding for a job? Another business idea? More communities? Content Creation? I'm not sure. There's so many options and it feels like I'm back to where I was a year ago before we started The 100 Club. An important consideration is that I'm going to be overseas for 1 year in Silicon Valley as well, starting in August. So I figure I'd like to have myself figured out by then. You’ve got guys like Easlo who niches down into Notion. But you’ve also got guys like Alex West that just threw spaghetti and ran with what stuck. So the question is whether to niche myself down into something, or let myself run free.

For some reason, I'm really drawn to the idea of communities, which is funny considering I'm a huge introvert who wouldn't have a problem if I had to not to talk to anybody forever. The business model intrigues me a lot, and I've been looking through quite a few different case studies on Mighty Networks and Starter Story. But the problem is that it's a huge people business, and while I may like the idea of it, I fear it'll grow into something that I dislike when I actually start working on it. That being said, I don't think I like community businesses, but rather community-based businesses. Nomadlist for example is one such business. It's a community built around the product of having a list of places somebody can travel to. Same goes with marketplaces I suppose.

My logic starting The 100 Club a year ago instead of running with a service based business is that I can always build a service based business down the road when I have more skill and connections. I think that logic still holds, which kicks out most service based businesses (even though I keep on getting drawn to them because I think they make money with a bit more certainty).

So I guess that pushes me towards starting an online business. But what niche is the question now.

I think I'm gonna run with community for now, and really start figuring out what I like and don't like. It'll be an exploration and 12 communities in 12 months doesn't sound like too bad of an idea. Onwards and upwards I guess.
